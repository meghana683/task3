## 📊 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project demonstrates **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** techniques for predicting house prices using Python. It uses popular libraries such as **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

---

### 📁 Project Structure

* `house_price_regression.py` – Main Python script with both simple and multiple regression.
* `house_prices.csv` – Dataset file (downloaded from Kaggle).

---

### 📦 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib

---

### ▶️ How to Use

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle:

   * [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
2. Save it as `house_prices.csv` in the project directory.
3. Run the Python script to see:

   * Simple Linear Regression (with one feature)
   * Multiple Linear Regression (with multiple features)
   * Evaluation results (R² score, Mean Squared Error)
   * Visual plot for simple regression

---

### 🔍 Features Used

**Simple Regression:**

* Living Area (GrLivArea)

**Multiple Regression:**

* Living Area (GrLivArea)
* Garage Capacity (GarageCars)
* Overall Quality (OverallQual)
* Basement Area (TotalBsmtSF)

---

### 📈 Outputs

* Model accuracy scores (R², MSE)
* Regression line plotted on a scatter plot (for simple regression)
* Model coefficients (for multiple regression)
